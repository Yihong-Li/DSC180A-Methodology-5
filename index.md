## Brainstorming for Quarter 2 Project Proposal

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic has been training Large Language Models (LLMs) on distributed systems using advanced memory management and parallelization techniques. Learning how to scale these models efficiently across multiple devices provided insight into handling computational constraints in real-world applications. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I am interested in exploring multimodal models that combine image data with LLM capabilities. This could lead to innovative applications like enhanced image captioning

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Consider optimizing parallelization techniques and memory management, like figuring out how to incorporate flash attention into the training process.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Reading and writing more open-source code. I’m open to suggestions on other techniques that could enhance the project's effectiveness.
